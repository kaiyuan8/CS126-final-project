For this project, I would like to create a virus spread simulation with each "particla" represent each individual and the "color" indicate the infection.

Virus will spread with face to face contact without qurantine, and each situation "wear a mask or not", "body health", etc. will affect the chance of infection. 
And this simulator will simulate the spread of virus on different conditions ("settings") and see how long ("average time") that need to take to have group fully infected.
And this also can be upgraded into real-life simulation of covid-virus where "group/Herd immunity ' might take places.

A complete particle movement smulation will be completed by the first week
A complete virus status will be cirrectly updated by the second week
A complete settings/choices to adjust simulator will be completed by the thrid week
